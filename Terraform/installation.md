# Terraform 

Terraform is an infrastructure as code tool using which we can provision and manage infrastructure in any cloud.


**Features:**

***1. Multi-Cloud Support:***
- Terraform supports multiple cloud providers, including AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and many others.
- This allows you to manage infrastructure across different cloud environments using a single tool.

***2. Code Reusability:*** 
- Terraform enables code reusability, which leads to reduced duplication, improved maintainability,
- and faster development cycles in managing infrastructure as code.

***3. State Management:*** 
- Terraform maintains a state file that keeps track of the current state of your infrastructure

***4. Plan and Apply Workflow:*** 
- Terraform follows a "plan and apply" workflow, where you first generate an execution plan to preview the changes
- Terraform will make to your infrastructure, and then apply the plan to make those changes.
