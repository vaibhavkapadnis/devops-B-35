${\color{Green} \textbf{1. \ Developement \ Team:}}$ Responsible for writing code

${\color{Orange} \textbf{2. \ Testing \ Team:}}$ Responsible for Testing code

${\color{Red} \textbf{3. \ Operations \ Team:}}$ Responsible for providing infrastructure setup
   
- So all the code is stored or integrated inside github
- We cant deliver code to client directly
  Wwe need to test this code
- So developers will test the code on machine/server where we need to install dependencies like
    - angular-frontend
    - java -backend
    - database server
    - tomcat for app
  so this set up we called as environment

- There are multliple environments present in a project such as
  
  ${\color{Green} \textbf{1. Dev}}$ : Where developers write and test code.
  
  ${\color{Orange} \textbf{2. Test}}$ : Where testers ensure the code works correctly
  
  ${\color{Yellow} \textbf{3. UAT (User Acceptance Testing)}}$ : Where customer will test the product
  
  ${\color{Red} \textbf{4. Prod}}$ : Where the final product runs for end-users.

- Installation of dependencies and particular version of software is a very difficult task
- To avoid these kind of environmental issues we are using docker
- Whatever the softwares we required is install using docker
  
##  ${\color{lightblue} \textbf{ Que. \ What \ is \ Docker \?}}$
${\color{lightblue}  \textbf{Docker}}$ 
- is an open source platform for developing, shipping and running applications in containers.
- containers are lightweight, isolated environments that package application and their dependencies together.
  
  **Benefits**
  - portability
  - scalability
  - consistency
  - resource efficiency
