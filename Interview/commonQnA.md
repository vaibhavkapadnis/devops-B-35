# $${\color {red} \textbf {Technical Interview Questions}}$$

## System and Network Administration

1. **What is an inode?**
    - An inode is a data structure on a filesystem on Linux and Unix-like systems that stores information about a file or a directory.

2. **What information is available in an inode?**
    - Inode information includes file size, device ID, user ID of the file's owner, group ID, number of links, file access, change and modification time, and pointers to the data blocks.

3. **How do you check CPU utilization?**
    - Use the `top` or `htop` command to check CPU utilization in real-time.

4. **How can you prioritize processes based on CPU allocation?**
    - Use the `nice` and `renice` commands to set and modify the priority of processes.

5. **I have created a different virtual host for Apache server, but I'm getting a forbidden error. How can I fix this issue?**
    - Ensure the firewall is properly configured to allow traffic to the new virtual host. Also, check and adjust SELinux permissions using `chcon` to set the correct context for the new directory.

6. **How do you enable SELinux for a new virtual host directory?**
    - Use the `semanage fcontext -a -t httpd_sys_content_t '/path/to/new/directory(/.*)?'` command followed by `restorecon -Rv /path/to/new/directory` to apply the new context.

## Scripting and Automation

7. **What is the difference between `grep` and `egrep`?**
    - `grep` is used to search text using basic regular expressions. `egrep` (or `grep -E`) is used for extended regular expressions.

8. **How do you create 10 directories named dir1, dir2, ..., dir10 using a loop in a bash script?**
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash

    # Loop to create directories
    for ((i = 1; i <= 10; i++)); do
        mkdir "dir$i"
    done
    ```

## Configuration and Deployment

9. **What is the purpose of MCP (Mission Configuration Properties)?**
    - MCPs are used to define configuration settings for a mission-critical application, ensuring consistent behavior across environments.

10. **How do you deploy an application using the source-to-image method with a source in GitHub and a local Docker image using `kubectl`?**
    - Use the `kubectl create deployment <deployment-name> --image=<local-docker-image> --replicas=<number-of-replicas> -- git-repo=<github-repo-url>` command.

## Kubernetes and Docker

11. **What is the difference between a ReplicaSet and autoscaling?**
    - A ReplicaSet ensures a specified number of pod replicas are running at any given time. Autoscaling adjusts the number of pod replicas dynamically based on resource usage or other metrics.

12. **Describe the request flow when accessing an application through an Apache service running in a pod.**
    - The request flows from the user to the Kubernetes service, which routes it to the appropriate pod running the Apache service. Apache then forwards the request to the backend application.

13. **How do you expose a pod in Kubernetes?**
    - Use the `kubectl expose pod <pod-name> --port=<port> --target-port=<target-port> --type=<service-type>` command.

14. **What is the difference between a route and a service in Kubernetes?**
    - A service exposes a set of pods as a network service within the cluster. A route (in OpenShift) exposes a service to external traffic by mapping it to a DNS name.

15. **What is the difference between a Secret and a ConfigMap in Kubernetes?**
    - A Secret is used to store sensitive data such as passwords and tokens. A ConfigMap is used to store non-sensitive configuration data.

16. **How do you check CPU utilization for all physical nodes in a cluster?**
    - Use the `kubectl top nodes` command.

## CI/CD and Build Tools

17. **In a pipeline, what is the "generate pipeline script" option?**
    - This option generates a Jenkins pipeline script based on the chosen configuration options, allowing you to automate the build process.

18. **Describe the Maven lifecycle.**
    - The Maven lifecycle consists of phases such as `validate`, `compile`, `test`, `package`, `verify`, `install`, and `deploy`.

19. **Are you using Artifactory?**
    - Artifactory is a repository manager that supports various package types, including Maven, Docker, and npm, to store and manage binary artifacts.

## Java and Repository Structure
